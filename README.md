# commit-reporting
For generating report what we committed at the day
1. open and cofigure config.js
2. npm install
3. npm start

note: 
- if want to generate report for certain date, edit index.js line 85 ( sorry I'm lazy :) )
- can fetch from multiple project and repo (see config.js)
- you may wondering why the output formatted, because I'm planning to auto post it to reporting service my team use, but I'm not motivated yet to continue this.
